# ping-pong

In order to run the programme you need to have the pygame library and Python 3 version. 

To control the first racket you need to press the keys: 'w', 's'. And to control the second racket with the keys: 'up', 'down'.

The task is to hit the ball flying at you, if it crosses the line behind your racket you lose.
